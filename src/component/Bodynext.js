          Trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every
          great human achievement. and consistently, its importance has been
          overlooked. not just by individuals, but by entire societies. we felt
          it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves. especially for
          the ones who live by this virtue: the trustworthy. so we thought of
          creating a system that rewards its members for doing good and being
          trustworthy. this way, trust as a virtue becomes something to aspire
          to, just the way it should be. then we went one step ahead: we built
          it. we know we are on the right track because here you are. if you
          make it to CRED, congratulations and welcome. we have a lot of things
          planned for you.
